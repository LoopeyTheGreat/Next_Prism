# Next_Prism PhotoPrism Proxy - Docker Swarm Stack
#
# This stack deploys the SSH proxy service for PhotoPrism commands.
# The proxy must run on the same node as the PhotoPrism container to enable
# docker exec communication.
#
# Prerequisites:
# - Docker secrets created: photoprism_proxy_pubkey, photoprism_proxy_privkey
# - PhotoPrism service running in Swarm
# - Overlay network 'nextprism_network' created
#
# Deploy:
#   docker stack deploy -c photoprism-proxy.yaml nextprism-pp-proxy
#
